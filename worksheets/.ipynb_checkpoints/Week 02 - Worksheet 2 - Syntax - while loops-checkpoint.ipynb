    "# Week 02, Worksheet 2: Python syntax (`while` loops)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "This worksheet will invite you to tinker with the examples, as they are live code cells. Instead of the normal fill-in-the-blank style of notebook, feel free to mess with the code directly. Remember that -- to test things out -- the <a href = \"../sandbox/CMPSC%20100%20-%20Week%2000%20-%20Sandbox.ipynb\"><b>Sandbox</b></a> is available to you as well.\n",

    "The work this week also offers the opportunity to tie up the server in loopish operations. Should you be unable to run cells, simply locate the <b>Kernel</b> menu at the top of the screen and click <b>Restart Kernel</b>. This should jumpstart the kernel again and clear out the infinite loop behavior.</div>\n",

    "We've mostly covered cases in which events or calculations need to happen one at a time or just one time in total. Occasionally -- much more than occasionally, really -- programs need to repeat instructions more than once until some given condition is met. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you read the word \"condition\" above and have started thinking `booleans` are involved: you're right yet again.\n",
    "\n",
    "While casually referred to as a \"loop\" structure, the technical term for this repetition is _iteration_ -- the process of repeating a set of statements until a given condition is no longer `True`. In the case of `while` loops, we can rephrase the statement above to read \"while the condition is true, repeat some statements\"\n",
    "\n",
    "`while` loops recall syntax similar to `if` statements:\n",

    "    # these\n",
    "    # statements\n",
    "```\n",

    "Again, notice that indentation plays a part here: everything indented underneat the `while` statement \"belongs to\" that `while` loop, and will be subject to repetition.\n",

Then we print that number followed by an instruction `seconds -= 1` to _decrement_ (decrease) that number by one _each time the loop runs_ (on each _iteration_). By the time we reach the end, the last run notices that `seconds == 0`, therefore `seconds` _is not_ greater than `0` anymore and it breaks out of the loop, executing the next statement after the loop.\n",
